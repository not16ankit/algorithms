# knn

The dataset is spread across 3 classes. 

![classes](https://github.com/not16ankit/knn/blob/main/knn.gif)
Red data point is taken for testing. The model is probability model but can be altered a bit here and there to be a one-value classifier.

The distance function is euclidean distance.
No scaling is done.
The code consists of K = 5 as default which avoids overfitting but also reduces model accuracy on train set itself.
