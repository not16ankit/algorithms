Describing a simple linear kernel SVM. It is a linear kernel which is why the algorithm uses the primal equation solutions. The algorithm still lacks an optimized stopping technique and the epoches are an estimate I made at the time of writing it. The intercept dimension is added into the w vector, in order to reduce computational load. The dual problem would make it a lot easier and faster.
